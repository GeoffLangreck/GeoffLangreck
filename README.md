I'm Geoff Langreck, currently making the leap into the tech industry with a focus on software development—specifically Python and SQL. My approach is hands-on: I learn best by building real projects, which helps deepen my understanding of core programming concepts and how they apply to actual problems.

What I'm Working On
Right now, I'm building a console-based garden manager app in Python. This tool lets users track, update, and store plant data using nested dictionaries and JSON files. The goal is to get practical experience with file handling, data structures, and managing the flow of a small application. Beyond practice, I’m designing this app to help schedule and organize tasks at work—giving it a real-world purpose.

Skills I'm Developing
Python: Building console applications, working with file input/output, and managing data with dictionaries and JSON
SQL: Writing basic queries and using SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN to interact with databases
Application Design: Planning and building small but complete projects from the ground up
Code Quality: Writing code that’s clean, readable, and modular

Looking Ahead
I’m interested in teaming up on beginner-friendly Python projects or automation tools—anything that reinforces practical development skills. If you’re working on something similar or want to collaborate, I’m open to new ideas and contributions.

How to Reach Me
You can check out what I’m working on over at my GitHub (still a work in progress). If you want to connect or chat about projects, feel free to email me at geoffreylangreck@gmail.com.
